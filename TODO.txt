REST API

- Allow editing and deleting user profile.
- Allow deleting a token if crendentials are provided. Shouldn't be needed though as it will expire in 30 minutes.

Teams: importable, tier, name - should be enough.
- Allow POST/creating a new team.
- Allow PUT/editing existing team.
- Allow DELETE/deleting existing team.

Extra:
- Organize code into several files.
- Add "last used"-field to users to automatically purge them.
- Limit the number of teams.
- Enable password recovery.
- Validate importables.
- Validate email, only "@" should be checked.
- Use NoSQL database instead of mysql for buzzwords.

Issues to solve:
- Integrate into webclient
  - Cross-domain REST -> relay has to do the RESTing?
- Integrate into Teambuilder
  - Should be easy to use, almost transparent.

Web GUI

- Need Design
- Not priority
